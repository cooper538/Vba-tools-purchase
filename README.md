# Useful excel workbooks with VBA

Here I put some of my workbooks that I created to support our purchase department.
They were build to transform exported data EPLAN (electro engineering software), but they will work with any other type of export. in the end, you can customize themðŸ˜‰

### Aggregate items
- transform the list of items to purchase to the aggregate list (*order number* is identifier)

### Diff two lists
- take two lists and return a list of difference among them
- helpful in a situation when you need to purchase material during the project before is finished

### Todo list -  email changes
- simple todo list for a generic project
- when you close workbook, an email with a list of changes will be generated and send it to involved persons
- see *config* sheet
